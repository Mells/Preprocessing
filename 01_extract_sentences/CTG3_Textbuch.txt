  Dear Ally, Please help, I’m desperate. You see, I might not get into the school football team this year. Last year our coach didn’t let me play in the last few games. But I was playing much better than the others when he stopped choosing me. I told the coach that I’m a Manchester United fan but he supports Arsenal. I’m sure that’s why

I think my brother knows how I feel but there’s no way I’m talking to him about it. What can I do to make his friend love me? Heartbroken, Camden 

  DearHeartbroken, Sounds like you really do need some advice. I think you probably just have a crush on your brother’s friend. You don’t seem to know that much about him and you can’t love someone you don’t know. And ten years is a big difference when you are only a teenager. Try to forget about him.

  DearAlly, I’m writing this letter to you because I really don’t know what to do about my sister. She’s a bit younger than I am and we argue all the time. She always comes into my room and wants me to help her with her homework. Mum says I should be nice to her and explain things to her but sometimes I don’t have the time. I have my own stuff to do, too. And then she always takes my clothes without asking. Last week I couldn’t find my favourite top. Where do you think it was? In my sister’s room of course! Mum and Dad think I’m the one being difficult. It’s not fair! Please help. We argue C.,Camden

  DearC.inCamden, You are not the first person to have problems with their sister. It’s perfectly normal. Obviously there are some things that you need to discuss. She should not take your things without asking. On the other hand you should think about your behaviour. You don’t seem to be very friendly towards her. Perhaps it would be a good idea to have a family conference. Your mum and dad could help you. Yours, Ally

  Part 1 

  The next day was Saturday – the day Gwynn was coming to meet Gillian for the first time. I was rather nervous about the visit so I decided to get up

  

  Then Gillian came down looking really miserable. I gave her a big smile and put the pancakes on the table but she said: “I’m not hungry!” I had been

  Part 2 

  So I had my coffee, took a deep breath and went up to her room. It was such a special day and I just wanted everyone to be happy. However, when I went in, she looked very sad. I sat down on her bed and put my arms around her. I could see that her eyes were red from crying and I felt for her. After a while I started to talk about Gwynn.

  30

  I told her about his job as a palaeontologist at Aberystwyth University. He’s so intelligent and does all this exciting work with fossils. Just

  ignored me. She just sat there looking tense. I thought she was acting rather strangely but I decided to ignore it and to tell her the news. I thought it was best to do it then and not wait for Gwynn as we had originally planned.

  At these words Gillian seemed to go into a state of shock. She just looked at me as if I had dropped a bombshell. I must admit I was a bit disappointed by her reaction.

  Duncan Dorfman hadn’t let his power out in order to impress 12 Andrew Tanizaki. Impressing him wouldn’t improve Duncan’s loneliness or nothingness at school. He had done it because he knew that if something unusual happened at their cafeteria table, the kids at the next table would know about it, too. 

  So after Duncan Dorfman read the instruction manual from Starpod Defenders aloud without looking at the words, he wasn’t surprised to see a boy across the way glance over. 

  Carl Slater was a smirking kid with a rust- colored buzz cut 13 that always looked freshly mowed. He sat in the cafeteria at the next table every day with a bunch of other kids, playing Scrabble ®. They were all members of the Drilling Falls Middle School Scrabble Club, though anyone who saw the way they behaved might have thought they were looking for trouble rather than a friendly game.

  “Um, Duncan?” piped up Andrew in a nervous voice, and he stood up. “I just remembered I have to go see the nurse about that nosebleed I had last week –” [...] 

  “I read the words with my fingers, not my eyes,” Duncan said. “It’s the thing I can do.”

  Wildings School 

  Home Intranet News Riding School Information 

  Girls Day and Boarding School 

  You can find Wildings School near Denbigh in North Wales. The school is 45 minutes away from the city of Chester, and one hour away from Liverpool and Manchester International Airport. 

  Wildings is the only school in the country with a riding school, a sailing centre, a swimming pool and a recording studio. We also have a special dance and music programme. 

  Many students choose to study at Wildings because English is the school’s first language. Students can study Welsh as an extracurricular subject. 

  Boarding is great for girls who want to live and learn together with all their friends. Our housemothers prepare breakfast for the girls each morning and do all cleaning and laundry for the first three years. 

  We expect our students to take part in 2-3 after-school activities per week. They have plenty of options to choose from: film club, choir, electronics club, art club, lacrosse, creative writing and many more. Students can have riding lessons at all times of the day and evening, too. 

  Fees: Boarding £ 4,350 to £ 4,850 per term

  With the sea on one side and Snowdonia on the other, where better to improve your education? It’s not all water and mountains, though! Your talents may lie in the laboratory, in design or on the sports field.Together with you and your parents, we aim to improve those talents.Welsh is also a compulsory subject. 

  St David’s is small enough to provide a real ‘family atmosphere’ for boarding school students There are three houses for boys and one for girls. Our houseparents look after our boarders.That means they have a housemother and a housefather. Most boarders are full boarders, but we also offer weekly and flexi-boarding. Each house offers a leisure room and a kitchen for snacks. Dormitories are small, with no more than 4-6 pupils per room. 6th Formers have single or double bedrooms. Every Davidean becomes a member of a ‘house’: Cader Idris, Snowdon or Tryfan. Day pupils, too, belong to these houses and take part in academic and cultural activities and sports for the House Cup each year.The House Cup includes football, swimming, hockey, cricket and tennis. 

  Outdoor education Making the most of the beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, beaches and sea near Snowdonia National Park, our pupils take part in different outdoor activities: climbing, kayaking, caving, sailing, orienteering, team tasks, mountain walking and beach activities are just a few examples.We use this huge outdoor classroom to add to the traditional classroom subjects. 

  Annual boarding fee: £ 16,950- £ 20,787 Entry is by selection or scholarship exam following an interview with the headmaster.

  who seem OK, but I think it’ll take years to make friends here, you know, they’ve been pals for a long, long time … The good news is that there are lots of boys at this school! However, the first day in class was a shock: only 12 students in our class, and the groups are even smaller for maths and English, it’s just 8!!! Can you imagine? You have to concentrate all the time. NO chatting, which is quite a challenge! But I must admit lessons seem to be more fun. It would even improve your maths, George. ;-) Of course, there is one compulsory subject that I don’t really like: Welsh! It looks like a secret code to me which seems like a waste of time! But maybe I can surprise Gruffudd. I must have told you that I have to wear school uniform now which I was sure I would hate. But it saves lots of time in the morning when you have to get ready for school ;-). And the school uniform we have to wear looks OK. Actually it makes me feel a bit better. As all the students wear uniform, you can’t really spot the girls who come from very rich families. 

  I’ve attached the daily timetable. Hard, isn’t it? You two should count yourselves lucky. But it’s fun, too, since the choice of subjects is just amazing. You can do them all for GCSE and for A levels, too!!! And there are lots of extracurricular activities which are fantastic … Can you imagine a husky expedition in Scandinavia or sea kayaking in Alaska? Sounds cool, right? – The students who have just come back talk about nothing else. And now it’s time to choose next year’s expedition. I just wonder who can afford to go. Our school is also big on supporting school children in Africa. Students go to Uganda and help at a centre for kids who live in Kampala. I might do that when I’m older … It would be great to be one of the students in day school who can go home after lessons. But Mum has promised that I can come home every weekend. It feels so strange not to be there when the “new family” is starting their life in Llandysul. They try to make it easier for us boarders. My tutor is in my house and there are houseparents so there is a family feeling, but I’d much rather be with my own family … 

  Miss you all! Gillian

St David’s is this big country house – well, not like the Harry Potter halls – but still very posh 3 . Luckily, the dorms are in modern buildings, so it’s more like a normal place. I share my room with five girls who seem OK, but I think it’ll take years to make friends 4 here, you know, they’ve been pals for a long, long time … The good news is that 5 there are lots of boys at this school!

  Wales for beginners 

  Wales ( Cymru ) is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. Being to the west of England, it has got more than 750 miles of coastline as it is bordered 1 by both the Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea. This means that the climate is moderate 2 , but often cloudy,

  5 

  10

  wet and windy. In fact Wales is known as one of the wettest countries in Europe. Wales is largely mountainous and Mount Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) is its highest mountain at 3,560 ft (1,085 m). 

  Two-thirds of Wales’ three million population live in the south, most of them in and around the port cities of Cardiff ( Caerdydd ), Swansea ( Abertawe ) and Newport ( Casnewydd ). With a population

  of 346,000, Cardiff, the capital of Wales, is the biggest city. 

  The country is represented by the symbol of the red Welsh Dragon, which is on the national flag. Some say it is the oldest national flag still in use, and that it was even used by King Arthur.

  1

  15 

  20 

  25

  Other national symbols include the leek 3 and the daffodil 4 . 

  Wales is officially bilingual 5 , which means that both Welsh and English have equal 6 status. More than 20% of the population speak Welsh, which is one of Europe's oldest languages. People in Wales try to keep their language alive 7 so pupils have to learn Welsh at school. You can also read a lot of Welsh when you are there: road signs are always in English and in Welsh, for example. 

  The most popular sports in Wales are football and rugby. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff is the country’s national stadium, where all the big rugby games take place. The atmosphere in the stadium and in Cardiff itself on match days is absolutely electric.

  

  Examples of traditional Welsh food are Bara Brith (fruit cake) or delicious sweet Welsh cakes. But many Welsh people also like cheese; the town of Caerphilly has a Big Cheese Festival every year. Famous Welsh people include soul singer Duffy, the rock band

  The Poison Apples 

  Everybody knows about the fairy tale of Snow White 1 and the seven dwarfs. Snow White’s life is in danger because her evil 2 stepmother, the queen, can’t bear the girl’s beauty and wants to murder her. Dressed up as an old woman, she offers her one of the beautiful red apples from her basket. Of course, the apples are poisoned 3 and meant to kill her. The title “Poison Apples” reminds us of this fairy tale and so it is no surprise that the teenage novel is about evil stepmothers. What makes it different is the fact that here three young girls who all feel betrayed and badly treated by their stepmothers want revenge 4 . But before they can start plotting, they have to meet at Putnam Mount McKinsey – a posh boarding school. 

  O1 The girl who tells the story – the first person narrator – is Alice. Read the first part of the extract and write a few sentences about the situation she is in. Use the questions who , where , when , what and why to collect information. Reading, p.142

  It was the first official day of classes. I had managed to get through three days of orientation without making a single friend, and now I was walking up a grassy hill toward the humanities building, toward my first class, all by myself. Surrounding me were clumps and pairs of my fellow students, giggling and talking and swinging their book bags by their side. 

  I walked through a set of big double doors and stopped in the lobby. It was a beautiful old building, with wooden floors and beams of light shining through stained-glass windows. I squinted at a sign with little arrows indicating classroom numbers and locations and then walked down a narrow hallway. My mouth was dry. I was worried nothing would come out if I tried to talk. 

  “Hi, Alice,” a high, nasal voice piped up next to me. 

  I turned and looked. It was the same shrimpy girl with glasses from the first night of school. Except this time she had a white band of gauze 5 wrapped around her head. 

  “Hi,” I croaked, and kept walking down the hall.

  She trotted alongside me. “You like artichokes, right?” “What?” 

  She giggled. “Remember? From the name game? You couldn’t think of a word that started with A ?” 

  Great. Even the nerdy 6 girl thought I was a loser. “I’m Molly Miller, by the way,” she added. 

  “Oh. Right.” I glanced up and down the hall, trying to find an escape route. 

  “I like the all-black thing,” she said. “It’s very Hamlet. Have you read Hamlet ?” I shook my head. 

  “You have to. By Shakespeare? It’s my favorite play. Hopefully we’ll get to read it sometime this year. Are you in Humanities 101 7 ?” she continued brightly. “Um, yeah.” “Me, too!” “Oh. Cool.” 

  “Hey!” she exclaimed, and stopped in her tracks. “This is our classroom!”

  I entered the classroom with my head ducked down and slid into a seat. I could see my classmates talking and laughing out of the corner of my eye. I was too freaked out to look at any of them directly. Molly immediately plunked herself down in the desk next to me and leaned over, propping her chin in her hands. 

  “English is my favorite subject,” she said in a loud whisper. “By far .” I nodded. 

  “I wonder what’s gonna be on the reading list.” 

  I nodded again. The last thing on my mind was the reading list. 

  Someone cleared his throat, and the classroom fell silent. I looked up. A young man – he was probably in his late twenties – was leaning against the desk at the front of the classroom, his arms folded. He was small and compact, with sparkling eyes, and his black hair was streaked with gray. “Hi, everyone,” he said. There was a general murmuring in response.

  “My name is David Newman,” he said. “Welcome to Humanities 101. I’ll be your teacher for the entire school year. So here’s hoping we don’t all hate each other.” 

  There were a couple of chuckles. Molly let out a burst of high-pitched 10 laughter. I winced. 

  “In this class,” David Newman began, moving behind his desk and sitting down, “we’re going to spend most of our time studying the Greats. Gilgamesh. The Odyssey. Henry the Fifth. Wharton’s House of Mirth .” 

  I could see Molly Miller nodding vigorously to the right of me. I had no idea what he was talking about. 

  “But,” he continued, “I’m going to start us off with a piece of twentieth-century literature. This is a fantastic work by a contemporary novelist 11 […].” […] 

  He reached into his desk, pulled out a book, and held it up in the air. I couldn’t see the title, but it somehow looked familiar. Something about its color and the blurry illustration on the cover … 

  “This is Zen Ventura ,” he announced. “Has anyone heard of it?”

  The Norman Conquest – How it might have happened

  In 1064, kidnappers in France captured Harold Godwinson, King Edward’s brother-in-law.

  

  You’ve saved my life! I promise to help you become the next king of England.

  Great!

  Wait! I’m I can’t wait.

  We want money or you’re a dead man.

  sure someone will help me.

  As soon as William of Normandy had heard the news, he went to rescue Harold. But Harold had to make a promise …

  

  When I rescued Harold, he promised to help me become king. 

  I really am. And I’m going to fight for the crown of England.

  You seem very angry.

  It’s no problem to cross the Channel.

  

  We can take 5,000 men and even our horses. 

  And food – and wine!

  January 1066: After King Edward of England had died, Harold became the new king. In Normandy, William was not very pleased …

  William planned to go to England with many ships and a huge army to fight against Harold.

  My feet are aching!

  I don’t really feel fit to fight.

  Let’s pretend we have given up.

  Why?

  Meanwhile Harold was having problems with another enemy. The King of Norway had landed in the north of England. So Harold and his army marched north to fight against him and defeated him. But the price was high. Harold’s army was tired and now they had to fight against William and his army in the south.

  When Harold’s soldiers 

  follow us, we will turn round. Our troops can then surround them from all sides and attack them.

  Harold’s men were tough and held their position against the Normans. After King Harold’s soldiers had almost won the battle, the Normans played a trick on the Saxons.

  

  I’ve built some castles to protect my new kingdom.

  Wow!

  William’s plan worked and he won the Battle of Hastings. Harold died because an arrow went right through his eye. So William became the new king and was called William the Conqueror. One of the many castles that William built was the White Tower, later known as the Tower of London.

  The (True) Story of Some Very Famous People in British History Written and performed by Year 8 – William Ellis School for Boys Scene 1: The Life of King Arthur The knights of England have come together for a tournament. Merlin challenges them to pull the famous sword Excalibur out 

  of the stone. Only Arthur can do this so he is declared king. Some time later he is married to Guinevere and it looks as if they will be happy. But there are some surprises. First Arthur is almost killed by the Black Knight. Later he is betrayed by Guinevere and finally he is killed by his ‘friend’ Sir Lancelot. A scene full of action. Scene 2: The Battle of Hastings It’s the year 1066. King Edward dies and Harold of Wessex is 

  crowned king. But his position is not safe. He is challenged by the King of Norway and marches his army to the north of England. The Norwegian army is defeated at Stamford Bridge but another enemy is waiting in the south. William of Normandy wants the English throne. Hundreds of tired British soldiers are murdered and Harold is killed by an arrow in his eye. Or is he? This scene about the most famous battle in British history is full of surprises. Scene 3: Shakespeare’s Great Tragedy William Shakespeare is having problems again. He cannot pay 

  his bills. He is offered a lot of money to write a new play for the Globe Theatre. Shakespeare’s plays are often performed there. But this time William is asked to write a comedy and not a tragedy and he only has three days to finish it. This scene is full of surprises about England’s greatest writer.

  you Edward? Elizabeth: What do you mean? Mary: I know your secret. The real Queen Elizabeth died when she was ten. They couldn’t find a girl to replace her so a young boy was chosen – Edward, the child of a servant. You are not the true Queen of England. You are a man. I know your secret 

  at last. Mary goes to Queen Elizabeth and pulls the wig away. Elizabeth: Who has betrayed me? Mary: I am not going to tell you who gave me this piece of information. You must give up your throne and let me become queen. England must be ruled by a Catholic monarch and the true religion must be 

  brought back to this country. Elizabeth: You scoundrel! Mary: I think another scoundrel will be 

  discovered when I tell everyone your secret. Elizabeth: Please! Don’t tell my secret! Mary: Then let me become queen!

  Edward! Mary leaves the bedroom. Queen Elizabeth calls the guards. Two guards come in. Elizabeth: Follow the person who was just in 

  my room. Guards 1 and 2: Yes, Your Majesty. Elizabeth: And take her to the Tower. Don’t believe anything she tells you. She’s 

  completely mad. The two guards run out. After a few minutes the two guards come back. Elizabeth: Has she been locked in the Tower? Guard 1: Yes, Your Majesty. You were right, she is completely mad. She said you were a 

  man. Elizabeth: Yes, well. That’s what I thought. She’s dangerous. She must never be let free again. Tell the Lord Chamberlain to come and see me. It is time that Mary, ‘Queen of 

  Scots’ was silenced. Guard 2: I’ll get him immediately, Your 

  Majesty. The guards leave and Elizabeth is alone again. Elizabeth: The Queen of England will never be blackmailed. Adieu, cousin Mary.

  Victorian Age There were many big events during Queen Victoria’s reign. Britain had the world’s first steam railway. People had their photo taken for the first time, and there were new inventions like the telephone, electric lighting and cars. In 1801 there were 16 million people in Britain. One hundred years later, in 1901, there were 41 million. At the end of the Victorian Age, Britain was an industrial nation, and most people lived and worked in towns and cities, not in the countryside like before. The Victorian Age is named after Queen Victoria.

  Doctor Who: Jetzt wieder im deutschen Fernsehen

  Das Warten auf neue Folgen hat endlich ein Ende: Doctor Who kehrt ins deutsche Fernse- hen zurück. Die aktuelle Staffel wird ab Dezember zu sehen sein. Doctor Who ist eine britische Science-Fiction- Serie, die 1963 bis 1989 auf BBC1 lief. Nach mehr als 15 Jahren Pause zeigte die BBC ab 2005 neue Staffeln der Serie. Im Mittelpunkt steht der Außerirdische Doktor, der durch Zeit und Raum reisen kann. Er verwendet dafür das Raumschiff Tardis, das wie eine Notruf-Tele- fonzelle aus den 60er-Jahren aussieht. In seinen Abenteuern kämpft er zusammen mit einer Begleiterin gegen verschiedenste Gegner aus unterschiedlichsten Zeiten und Welten. Der Doktor ist als so genannter Time

  Lord über 900 Jahre alt – auch wenn man ihm das nicht ansieht. Der Doktor wurde seit 2005 von verschiedenen Schauspielern gespielt: auf Christopher Eccleston folgten David Tennant, Matt Smith und schließlich Peter Capaldi, der den inzwischen zw ö lften Doktor verk ö rpert. In Großbritannien sind die Abenteuer des Dok- tors seit Jahrzehnten äußerst populär. Obwohl die Serie durchaus spannungsgeladene und mitunter horrorartige Szenen aufweist, gilt sie als Familienserie.

  Sarah’s heart sank. Seven Dials was a rat-infested slum, a maze of narrow streets where every sort of crook 4 and low-life lived, amongst ordinary honest but poor people who couldn’t afford to live anywhere better. The place was called Seven Dials because seven streets met together in a square. […] It was the last place she [Sarah] wanted to go herself, let alone take princess Beatrice. But if she refused 5 , then the princess would be angry with her and would demand 6 she be dismissed 7 . 

  “If Your Highness insists 8 ,” said Sarah unhappily. “I do,” said Beatrice. 

  And so the two girls continued along Pall Mall, heading towards Trafalgar Square. […] At Trafalgar Square, Sarah steered Beatrice towards St Martin’s Lane. 

  “We’ll follow this lane, Your Highness,” she said. “But I would advise you to keep your head

  “And what will happen to me then?” asked Beatrice, with a smile. 

  “Beggars will bother you for money,” said Sarah. “Perhaps worse. Some will try and rob you. And, if you resist, they can be violent.” 

  Beatrice hesitated 9 . […] Sarah could tell she was having second thoughts. This place was only a short distance from the wealth and safety of Buckingham Palace, but conditions in Seven Dials were a world away from the life of the royal family. But then Beatrice’s face took on that same defiant look Sarah had seen so often before. […] 

  “I am not afraid,” said Beatrice flatly. “Let us go in.” “Very well, Your Highness,” said Sarah.

  other since the weekend in Wales. Rajiv: Mmmh … do you believe her?

  lived with her day in, day out, you would buy her the train ticket to Aberystwyth with your pocket money.

  George tells Rajiv … 1 that Caroline said that Gethin was just a friend. 2 that Caroline explained that her PalPlace status 

  was none of Rajiv’s business. 3 that Caroline told him that she hadn’t texted Gethin since the trip to Wales.

  4 that Caroline thought that Gethin was funny. 5 that he pointed out to Caroline that Rajiv was 

  upset about her PalPlace status. 6 that Caroline mentioned that she and Gethin were still in touch online.

  d) v Extra: Comment on what George tells Rajiv about his conversation with Caroline and what he keeps secret. Why might he do that? Do you think he was right to do so? Give reasons. 

  B3 Grammar detective: reported speech

  1 Look at these statements from B2: “It was just a normal weekend trip.” “I don’t know what you are all so excited about.” Copy the statements and write down how they are reported in Rajiv and George’s dialogue. 

  B4 Hi Caroline,

  2 Find out how the tenses are changed when you report what someone said. 

  Start a grammar card on reported speech. 3 Look at LiF 17 (p. 167) to check your grammar card. Check what else changes in reported speech in LiF 17b. P3, P4 WB B2-B4, pp.64-66

  a) Read Gethin’s email to Caroline. Decide which of Gethin’s statements might have the strongest effect on Caroline. Give reasons for your choice.

  I miss you so much. It has become very boring again since you left. Maybe it is time for me to travel a little bit. You know it’s Valentine’s Day soon. It would be so nice to meet that day. Maybe I can stay in your brother’s room. Then I can get to know you and Gillian’s other friends. I hope you will say yes. Love, Gethin

  b) Caroline is very confused about the email and calls Gillian to tell her about it. Write down what she tells Gillian. Use reported speech. Don’t just use say or tell as reporting verbs. You can also use verbs like hope , explain , write , suggest , insist . LiF 17: Reported speech, pp.167/168

  

  Hi, Gillian, 

  Gethin sent me an email. You’ll never believe what he wrote. Charlie and Rajiv would never do anything like that. I wish I had never met him. I don’t really know what I should do now. He said that …

  a) Read what Gethin told Caroline about rugby:

  2. You can check your answer 

  on page 257. 3. You need help? › Do a), then b). You can do it? › Do b).

  “I started playing rugby when I was eight. My brother was already a member of our local team at that time and he took me to rugby training. I enjoyed it, so I joined a team, too. It is a tough sport, but I think it’s much more exciting than football. My team scores 20, maybe 30 points, not just one or two goals.” 

  Caroline tells Gillian what Gethin told her. Choose the right tense for the verb. 

  Caroline: “Gethin said that he 1 started/has started/had started playing rugby when he 2 is/was/had been eight. 

  He told me that his brother 3 was already/had already been/has already been a member of their local team and he 4 had taken/took/has taken Gethin to rugby training. He explained to me that he 5 enjoyed/had enjoyed/has enjoyed it, so he 6 has played/played/had played rugby ever since. He pointed out that it 7 was/had been/has been a tough sport, but he 8 thinks/thought/has thought it 9 is/was/had been much more exciting than football. He told me that his team 10 scores/scored/had scored 20, maybe 30 points, not just one or two goals. 

  b) When Caroline was in Wales, Gillian heard a conversation between Gethin and Caroline. Write down what she tells Emma about it later. 

  Gethin said that …

  Gethin: It must be very exciting to live in 

  London. Caroline: Well, you can do a lot of things in 

  Wales that you can’t do in London. Gethin: It can get a little boring here because there are hardly any people around. And 

  they are not as nice as you … Caroline: You don’t really mean that …

  Gethin: You Londoners have got no idea how 

  boring it can get here. Caroline: I was born in Manchester and my 

  father’s family comes from Greece. Gethin: That sounds interesting. I’ve never met 

  anyone like you. Caroline: You probably say that to all the girls … Gethin: There are no other girls.

  P4 Reported speech (2) Read what Caroline told her mother on the phone about her journey to Wales. Imagine that Mrs Lambraki told the rest of the family about it the next morning. Use reported speech to say what Caroline said on the phone. LiF 17: Reported speech, pp.167/168 She told me …

  Support Pay special attention to personal pronouns and possessive determiners and also to words that refer to time and place . Look at LiF 17b on page 168 for help.

  “ I ’m glad I ’m finally here . The train was really slow today . There was a very strange woman in the seat next to me . She talked to me about her family. She wanted to know everything about my family, too. I ’m still a bit nervous now when I think of her. I think she was crazy. So you can’t imagine how glad I was to see Gillian and her mum at the station .

  P5 Reading Reading, p.142 

  a) Read the following information for children and teenagers about staying safe online. Write down the answers to the following questions. 

  1 Why should you keep 

  passwords secret? 2 What other information 

  should you keep secret? 3 Why should you only meet people who you 

  know in real life? 4 What problems can you have with emails? 

  b) Which three pieces of advice do you consider most important? Give reasons.

  Tips for staying safe online 

  What information shouldn’t I put online? Don’t give out any personal information online as people may use it to contact you even if you don’t want them to. If your parents or teachers have not said that it is OK to do so, you should never give away: • your real name or your friends’ names, • your home, school or email address, • your home or mobile phone number, • a photo of yourself, • your or your parents’ bank or credit card details. 

  Can I meet people I met online in person? Don’t meet anyone you have just met online even if you feel you know them well.This can be dangerous because some people simply lie about who they are. 

  Do passwords keep you safe? Don’t even tell your best friend.Try not to use names of your family or pets because people can guess them quite easily. It’s much better to use a mix of letters and numbers. 

  What should I do if I get a strange email? If you get an email with rude things in it, tell an adult and don’t answer it! Remember that it isn’t your fault if someone has sent it to you. 

  What about social networking sites? Social networking sites can be dangerous because some people post too much personal information on them. Keep your password secret as other people could write nasty things in your name.

  Sein Fehler: Er gab auch an, in welcher Stadt er wohnte, und zeigte sein Haus. Die Folge: Nur kurze Zeit später stattete ein Einbrecher der Familie einen Besuch ab. Er hatte es auf die Ersparnisse abgesehen, die er im Internet gesehen hatte. Doch daraus wurde nichts. Der sparsame Opa wohnte inzwischen woanders. Ganz ohne Beute zog der Einbrecher dennoch nicht ab. Er packte ein paar andere wertvolle Dinge ein und verschwand.

  In Britain, there are three different kinds of TV channel. First of all, there is the BBC. It was the first public broadcasting organization in the world and it started with radio in 1922. The BBC began its first regular TV service in 1936. It is active worldwide with its radio and TV stations as well as its website, and BBC One and Two are still among the most popular TV channels in the UK. Since the beginning of digital television, the BBC has started more channels, e.g. BBC Three and BBC Four. The BBC is financed by a TV licence. There are also independent TV stations. They earn their money with the help of TV commercials 1 . The biggest ones are ITV, Channel 4 and Five, which everyone can watch for free. Finally, there is also pay TV with Sky as the main provider.

  Dear partner, Ich heiße Rajiv Khan und ich bin 13 Jahre alt. Ich wohne mit meiner Familie in Camden Town, London. So that’s about as far as my German goes, I’m afraid. I’ve only had German lessons for a few months. However, I’m sure you speak good English. When did you start to learn English at school? I’m really looking forward to coming to Germany so that I can improve my German. Firstly, I would like to tell you something more about my family. My parents’ families originally came from India. That’s why we sometimes speak Hindi at home – but don’t worry, everyone speaks really good English. My parents have a shop and our flat is above it. When you stay with us, you will share a room with me, or, if you are a girl, with my sister Sheree. Have you got any brothers or sisters? My hobbies are playing football and cricket – I’m in the school cricket team. Do you know what cricket is? Perhaps we can watch a game when you come. I’m also keen on music and play the guitar. What about you? What are you interested in? After school and at the weekend I spend time with my friends. We often play football in the park. As soon as you come, George, my best friend, wants to organize a game between England and Germany. Do you play football? Sometimes I have to help my parents in their shop. Don’t worry, though! While you are here, we can do lots of nice things together and I won’t have to work. I have attached a photograph of me in my school uniform. Could you please send me one of you? Hope to hear from you soon. Yours, Rajiv Khan

  Mr Lewis: How are you getting on with Leon, 

  Rajiv? He seems very nice. Rajiv: Well, he isn’t always easy to get on with. 

  He’s really choosy about food and drink. Mr Lewis: Oh, is he? Rajiv: He asked me if he could have a glass of water. But he didn’t want the glass of tap water I gave him. He asked me if we had any bottled water! There’s nothing 

  wrong with our tap water! Mr Lewis: But he usually drinks bottled water, Rajiv. He doesn’t know that it’s not what you usually drink 

  here. Rajiv: OK. But when I told him that Mum had made a special curry for him, he asked me if we always ate curry. And 

  he didn’t look very happy. Mr Lewis: Well, I suppose it is sometimes difficult for young people coming here for the first time. Not everyone likes spicy food, you 

  know. Nigel: But Mr Lewis, my partner had lots of personal questions, too. He asked me if my dad earned a lot of money because we’ve got 

  a swimming pool. Holden: Well, he does, doesn’t he? But I know what you mean. My partner, Lina, asked me

  why my mum made tea with tea bags. She 

  said, “We use real tea in Germany.” Mr Lewis: Well, that is one of the things you’ll be able to check when we go there. I’m sure you’ll find other cultural differences as well. 

  That’s what makes it interesting. Robin: But they seem to think everything is better in Germany, sir. My partner asked me why my dad didn’t drive a 

  German car. Rajiv: Well, one difference seems to be that Germans ask lots of rather direct 

  questions. Leon asked me if I had any other music when I tried to 

  get him interested in Indian music. Nigel: Well, I’m not surprised. Who wants to 

  listen to that awful rubbish? Rajiv: Perhaps Leon should stay with you. 

  Neither of you seem to like Indian people. Mr Lewis: That’s enough, Rajiv. I’m sure that’s not true. Now Nigel, I don’t want you making comments like that. If you can’t be more tolerant, I might have to change my mind 

  about taking you to Germany. Nigel: Sorry, sir.

The southern part of the lane is one long line of curry and balti houses mixed with fabric shops and Indian supermarkets. Sadly, the once high standard of cooking in the curry houses is a distant memory. If you want to eat a curry, it’s better to go elsewhere.

However, she soon found out that she was a talented sprinter and developed a real passion for the sport. Since then, she has competed for many years. Probably the biggest event in her career was the 2012 Paralympics in London. In addition to her training, Sally is also keen to continue focussing on her education. After completing her GCSEs, her ambition is to go on to study for her A levels and attend university.

So Gloria and LeBron moved home many times. But LeBron didn’t make friends easily. Although he found it difficult to concentrate at school, he could show his intelligence and his determination in sports. LeBron was an excellent athlete because he had speed and strength.

  paper or fags. Most of them were polite but one or two made comments under their breath 3 , mainly stuff I couldn’t understand because they had mumbled it. I ignored it all and waited for my dad to finish what he was doing. 

  It was nearly an hour later when two men came in, sneering at me 4 and then smiling to each other. I sensed trouble straight away. There was just something in the way that they were looking at me. And each other. […] The shorter man spoke first. 

  “Twenny B&H.” Just like that. No please. No mate. 

  I coughed. My dad must have realised that I was trying to catch his attention, because he walked in and looked at the two men. He told me to sit down, in Punjabi, and faced the shorter man. “What you after, mate?” he asked, smiling. […] “Twenny B&H,” he spat out. 

  My dad turned and got the fags from the shelf and put them down on the counter. He waited for the money. The taller man looked around and then pulled a 20 pound note from his trousers, screwed it up 5 and threw it into my dad’s face. I got angry and stood up but the man just laughed at me and then his face got deadly serious. 

  “Sit down, Paki 6 ,” he whispered to me. “I’m not here to hurt yer unless you make me.” 

  I stood my ground 7 and stared into his pale blue eyes. They didn’t blink once. “Leicester’s easy to go back to,” he told my dad. 

  “You can just jump in yer Paki wagon and 40 minutes from now you’ll be back in Pakistan,” added the short one.

  

  My dad told them the price of the fags and waited. I could tell that he was fuming 8 , but he didn’t show it. 

  “Just a friendly piece of advice,” said the taller man. He picked up the 20 from the counter where it had fallen and smoothed 9 it before putting it back on the counter. 

  My dad picked it up and cashed up the fags, laying the change 10 down on the counter. The shorter man picked up the money and pocketed it while the other one started to sniff the air. 

  “Smell that?” he whispered, to no-one in particular. “Smells like petrol 11 .” He looked me in the eye and smiled. 

  “Just like petrol,” he repeated before both of them left the shop. 

  My dad went around to the front of the counter after the two men and locked the door behind them. He turned to me and tried to smile. Tried to pretend it was nothing. 

  “They just idiots, innit,” he said, not looking me in the eye. 

  “I think you should report them to the coppers 12 ,” I said, trying to stay calm. 

  “No point, beteh . They not doing anything. Just messing ’bout,” replied my dad, not looking at all sure about what he was saying. 

  “Dad – they weren’t messing about. At least report them – that way …” 

  “No, Jaspal. I don’t care about them mens. It’s my country too.” 

  I shook my head and went back upstairs, wondering when the next warning would come.

  New life in the city 

  When she went into the room, there was Nick with two other boys and two girls. Nick turned towards her. “Hi, Nick, congratulations. I hear your school has been very successful in the Clean Glasgow project,” Emma said, trying to hide her frustration. 

  “Hi, Emma. I hope you had a good flight. Come and meet my friends. Emma is a very big supporter of green ideas,” Nick said to his friends. “Maybe she can help us.” 

  They all talked to her at the same time and told Emma that their school was quite successful in the Clean Glasgow project: they had collected waste around the school and in the neighbourhood and they had thought about reducing waste and litter at school. There was also an initiative to offer healthier food in the cafeteria. But what they actually wanted was something new, something different, something positive – like a school garden or planting apple trees outside the school … 

  Emma was thrilled. She had wanted to do something different herself and now she was together with this group of friends who shared her view and wanted to act. Emma tried to think of an idea. Growing things might be good. Suddenly Emma remembered a report she had seen. “That’s it,” she said. “Why don’t you try something like The Edible Bus Stop ?” 

  An Urban Garden for Your Bus Stop 

  It was a small piece of empty land on Landor Road in the Lambeth section of London, as boring as the #322 bus stop it sat behind. But last spring, a small group of people got together to take back the area. They did a little guerrilla gardening and were able to start a proper garden, called the Edible BusStop. If possible, they hope their idea will grow and grow, and not just down the #322 route.

  Emma laughed, too. “No, really, it’s about using the bus stop areas and planting vegetables on them. It’s a project in London and I think it’s been a great success.” Emma explained how the project helped people to make their area look nicer and feel it belonged to them. “So they don’t vandalize it anymore.” 

  They all looked at Emma and she wasn’t sure what they thought of her suggestion. 

  But then one of the boys said enthusiastically: “Sounds cool. Why don’t we check the Internet? There must be something, a video, or maybe they’ve got a website.” 

  Everyone got really excited. “Yeah, let’s do that – and then we could try it out! Make an ugly bus stop look like a little garden. That would be a much better start than just project plans or posters, don’t you think?” 

  It was a crazy idea, but Nick liked it. He was worried that it might seem wrong to start a project like that in secret, but maybe not. So the next day they went to a garden centre to buy some flowers and vegetables that weren’t too expensive. 

  Later that night Nick, Emma and Nick’s friends started their first guerrilla gardening.
