  Eating out 1 in Great Britain

  A

  Many people think that British food is boring and does not taste 2 good. But if you go to Great Britain you may get a surprise 3 . There are so many different kinds of restaurants. British people don’t eat only traditional English food. Many people go to Indian

  5 restaurants in the evening. Curry is very popular.

  You can find lots of really good restaurants and cafés. There are many interesting places to eat, like in a London bus. In Camden Lock Market you can find everything you like, for example, Mexican 4 and Chinese 5 food and home-made 6 pizza. 

  Of course, you can also eat traditional English food, like fish and

  chips 7 . Often the best place to find this is in a pub 8 . You can also get a traditional English breakfast with eggs, bacon and beans 9 . But most people only eat toast and cereals 10 for breakfast.

  1

  D There are different foods in different regions of Great Britain.

  20

  For example, fish and seafood 11 are very popular along the coast 12 . Or you can try some Scottish food when you are in Scotland. What about some haggis 13 ? 

  But above all 14 Britain is a multicultural country 15 . There are many people from India 16 or the Caribbean 17 . They bring their food and traditions with them. So when you go to Great Britain, you can try different kinds of food from many different countries. 

  1 a) Read the text and match the photos to paragraphs A-D.

  2 Find out more about traditional English food on the Internet.

  Animals in London

  A

  Did you know that there are lots of interesting animals in London? For example, there are the famous ravens 1 at the Tower. The Tower is an old castle on the River Thames. A legend says that if the ravens leave the Tower, England will 2 come to an end.

  5 That is why there are still ravens at the Tower today.

  B

  You love horses? Well, so does the Royal Family. The Queen has her own Horse Guard 3 : forty soldiers 4 who in old times were the ‘body guard’. Today you can still see them parade and stand on guard 5 with their horses. Many people come to take photos with

  10 the horse guard.

  C

  London Zoo is the place to see interesting animals – but why can you find red squirrels 6 there? Well, in England there are not many red squirrels anymore because the grey squirrel from America has taken over 7 . London parks are full of the funny animals and

  15 children love to feed them.

  D

  There are lions in the middle of London: in Trafalgar Square. You can find them near the column 8 of Admiral Nelson. Nelson beat 9 the Spanish Armada so England became the most powerful nation 10 in the world. The lion is the king 11 of the animals and

  1

  E

  20 

  25

  stands for 12 power. When you walk through London you can find many plaques or pub signs 13 with lions on them. Often they are not alone: there is another animal, too – the unicorn 14 . Of course, it is not a real animal, but it is beautiful and very special. Like the lion, it is a symbol and stands for a noble 15 character and purity 16 . 

  Sharks 17 in London – real ones! Not in the Thames, but just a few footsteps away 18 . Cross 19 the bridge from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben and you are at the London Aquarium. Here you can see fantastic turtles 20 , colourful fish and sharks. You walk under the water through corridors of glass, so you feel like you are

  snorkelling 21 in a tropical underwater world. 

  1 a) Imagine you are in London. Which animals would you like to see and why? 

  b) Read about animals in London. Match the photos to the texts. 

  c) Look around your town for animals on monuments, in parks, on signs etc. and make a photo page for animals in your town. Portfolio
