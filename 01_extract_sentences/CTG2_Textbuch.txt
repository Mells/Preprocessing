  them all. Gillian: So, what did you do at the pony camp? Emma: We really had a lovely time: we cleaned the stables and went for rides. It was so much fun! We want to go again next year. Hey, why don’t you come with us?

  Emma: Well, after the start Donald suddenly stopped and I fell off. It was terrible!

  Gillian: Well, I really like animals but I don’t think I’m a country person. There are no shops and no cinemas in the country. And

  George loved Beam House. He likes action and at Beam House you get a lot of that. On his first day he went surfing and abseiling. The next day, he went on the zip wire after breakfast. Later he also took some cool photos of the older kids doing motorsports on the quad bikes. At five o’clock everyone at Beam House met to go orienteering. In George’s group were Brady,

  10 Anna and Claire. The instructor gave them a “Hey, calm down! We’re a team, remember?”

  map. They had to use a compass to find a treasure box and get back to Beam House as fast as possible. The girls were very excited. First Claire took the compass and started to

  and George followed. “Walking around with a compass doesn’t sound like a lot of fun,” George thought, “but if I have to take part, I want to win.”

  “If you think you can do a better job, here you go!” Claire gave George the compass and looked at him angrily.

  Holidays in Britain 

  Great Britain has miles and miles of coastline 1 with spectacular cliffs and long, sandy beaches. You can enjoy the fantastic scenery 2 and of course the seaside is a paradise for all watersports. Especially in Cornwall, where huge waves 3 roll in from the Atlantic, body boarding is a special sport that you might like to try.

  5 Or maybe you are more interested in wildlife? There are many ideal places for

  birdwatching and you can see deer 4 or badgers 5 in the countryside. The islands north of the Scottish coast are not only famous for their ponies, but the Shetland

  Are you keen on futuristic places? Then visit Project Eden, where an artificial biosphere 10 makes it possible to walk through a man-made tropical jungle 11 in England. 

  Who wants to go to school in the holidays? Well, why not visit the places where

  2. The Celts were not only good fighters, but also good farmers. They usually lived in round houses, often on the top of hills.

  3. In 55 and 54 BC, Julius Caesar and his army landed in Britain. However, the Romans felt that the Celts and the British weather were too much for them and left.

  4. In AD 43, the Romans invaded Britain again and this time they stayed in Britain and took control of the south of England. They hoped for better trade with the Celts.

  5. The Romans brought a lot of new things with them: they built roads, temples, baths and stone houses and they brought new entertainment, such as gladiator fighting and wine.

  6. Not all the Celts were happy with the Romans. The Celtic queen Boudicca and her men fought against the Romans in AD 60 and burned down some cities like London. In the end, however, the Romans won.

  Bonfire Night 

  Remember, remember, the fifth of November! On November 5th 1605 Guy Fawkes and a group of men tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament in London to kill King James I. But their plan did not work. When people found out that the king was safe, they lit bonfires to celebrate. It is now a tradition to celebrate this event with fireworks and a bonfire. In the past, children made dummies of Guy Fawkes to ask people for ‘a penny for the Guy’. As it is usually cold in November, we have food that keeps us warm, like baked potatoes. But marshmallows and toffee apples are everyone’s favourite food on Bonfire Night!

They’re really looking forward to it because there’ll be boys there! They haven’t got any brothers, you see! If you like, I’ll invite Denah, too. She’s really 

  nice and she thinks you’re cool! George: If you invite her, I’ll never speak to you again! If she comes, she’ll follow me around all the time and she always wants to talk George: So what do you want me to do? about football. Rajiv thinks it’s really funny, If I tell him about Emma, he’ll probably be but it’s just embarrassing. too embarrassed to come!

  scare the girls. Caroline: Very funny! But are only two boys coming, George? That’s not many. 

  Did Rajiv ask Rick? George: Well, he asked him and Holden, but they’re not sure. Maybe they’ll go to 

  Alexandra Palace to see the fireworks. Caroline: But Rick must come! If he doesn’t come, Emma will be so unhappy. She’s got a big crush on him and she’s so excited about the party.

  Caroline: That’s true. But why don’t you talk to Rick and Holden and tell them that they can come after the fireworks. If the party’s good, there’ll still be some people here. And it won’t be much fun if we don’t invite some more 

  boys for my friends. George: What do you mean – if the party’s good? Of course it’ll be good. There’ll be a big bonfire and Mum says she’ll make some souflaki for the barbecue, and there’ll be hot 

  dogs and … Caroline: But that’s only part of the fun, George. It’s not so important how much food and drink we have. I’m really worried that not many boys will come. My friends can’t wait to meet your friends. They’ll be really disappointed if there aren’t many boys! Please talk to Holden and Rick on Monday.

  B1 a) Read the chat messages to find out who wants to visit London. What are the friends planning to do? 

  Caro: Hi Sophie + Rob. It’s cool that you can come for the weekend. George and I have already made plans to show you around London! :-) 

  SOPHEE: Can’t wait to see you again. A weekend in London is just so cool. You know I’ve never been to London before, so I’m really looking forward to it. Hope it’s not only sightseeing though. ;-) 

  Caro: Don’t worry. We haven’t planned too much sightseeing although the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum are worth a visit. There are also some interesting places you haven’t heard about, yet – like the Film Museum next to the London Eye. Is there anything you especially want to see? 

  SOPHEE: I’d love to go to Buckingham Palace. And what about Notting Hill, where all the film stars live? 

  Rob: No way! Sophie has read about all the film stars in London and she hasn’t talked about anything else since. I don’t want any more of that!!! 

  Caro: Hmm, we could do Buckingham Palace. But you can’t go in. I’ve checked the Internet. It’s only open to visitors in the summer … And if you’re into film stars, then what about Madame Tussauds? 

  SOPHEE: Sounds great! I’ve always wanted to go there. My friend Cherry has just been there. She said there is a Chamber of Horrors. 

  Rob: Great idea! Anyway, I guess the London Eye is a must. And I think the Emirates Stadium sounds great. 

  Georgie: The Emirates Stadium? You must be joking! Have you turned into an Arsenal fan, Rob? ;-)) To be honest, it doesn’t sound that exciting. If you want to do a stadium tour, I think the Wembley Stadium would be more interesting. 

  Rob: Don’t worry – I haven’t changed my mind about Manchester United!!! Wembley is OK with me, but it’s not that high on my list. What I’d really like to do is to go to a big music store. 

  Caro: Buckingham Palace, Madame Tussauds, the London Eye … Cool! Sounds like a busy weekend. Why don’t we go on a sightseeing tour? We’ll find out more about it … Mum and Dad have offered to pay for tickets! :-) Looking forward to seeing you!!!

  The museums in Kensington Three of the most popular museums in London are close together in Kensington: the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. At the Science Museum you can see, touch and experience the most important developments 4 in science in the last 300 years (including spaceships) – and don’t forget the awesome IMAX cinema. Next door, in the Natural History Museum, you can find a moving model of Tyrannosaurus Rex – his eyes follow you around the room and he roars 5 very loudly when hungry! At the Victoria and Albert Museum you can see a fantastic fashion collection. 

  This is only a small selection of London museums. You might like to visit one of the more unusual museums, such as the Horniman Museum, where you will discover a brilliant aquarium and a rare collection of Asian and African masks. Or why not go to the London Transport Museum? Or to the Florence Nightingale Museum or …?

  At the audition, Anastasia was first. When she went on the stage, her face was sad. “OK, let’s hear your part, then!” Ms Walsh said kindly. All the girls were quiet. Anastasia started, but she spoke very slowly: “Will I have to … stay in … the shadows forever? ...” “Come on, Anastasia! You know your words, don’t you?” “I do, Miss, but …” Anastasia whispered and then she began to cry.

She knew the words and spoke clearly: “Will I have to stay in the shadows forever? …” “Word, words, words,” Emma said quietly, “but no emotion!” But Moira’s friends clapped excitedly. Caroline watched them. “You’re right,” she answered nervously. 

  On stage Caroline wanted to be the best actress. She really liked the role and she knew she could be better than Moira. “Will I …,” Caroline started loudly, but then she looked at Moira and her friends. They gave her the thumbs down behind Ms Walsh’s back. Caroline started to stammer. She tried to remember the words, but suddenly she couldn’t remember anything.

  Caroline was really upset. Emma tried to calm her down but Caroline didn’t want to listen. “You know why I mucked it up?” she shouted angrily. “It was just because of Moira’s friends – they pulled faces at me and now they’ve won.” “We should talk to Ms Walsh,” Emma suggested. “And tell her I was tricked out?”, Caroline said. “No way! Then she’ll think I’m just telling a sob story because I want to get the leading role. Anyway, Ms Walsh has offered me another job – she said I could be the prompter. That’s OK.” Caroline tried to sound cool, but Emma knew that her friend was hurt. 

  On Friday it was drama group again. That evening Caroline wrote in her diary: 

  Dear Diary, I feel awful. At least I don’t have to be on stage with Moira. The way she acts just makes me sick. She ruins everything!!! 

  All week Caroline was very gloomy. When George asked her what was wrong, she didn’t answer. So George asked Emma. “That audition was just so unfair,” Emma said angrily. “The first night with Moira will be a nightmare for Caroline.” George felt sorry for his sister. He wasn’t that interested in drama, but he still thought it was unfair. “We must do something to cheer her up,” he suggested. “Hey, there’s a Popsicles concert on the day of the first performance. Maybe I can get some tickets for Caroline and me.” “What a great idea!” Emma answered. “But I don’t think she can go. You know she’s the prompter. She has to be there like everyone else.” “But her job is backstage, so anyone can do it. I’m sure someone else can do it for her.”

  A few days later, Caroline found an envelope in her room. Inside there were tickets for the Popsicles concert. Caroline couldn’t believe it … 

  It was the last week before the play started. The girls tried on their costumes. The boys in the band were ready. Everything was prepared. But Ms Walsh was a bit worried. Moira wasn’t very good. She spoke clearly and knew her words, but she didn’t say them with feeling. But it wasn’t only that. Moira was often difficult and the other girls on the stage were often tense when Moira was around. But it was too late now. Finally, everyone was ready. But where was Moira? Ms Walsh was annoyed. She was really fed up with Moira, who always pretended to be a star. Finally, Moira arrived. “Oh, Ms Walsh,” she whispered sweetly, “I need a microphone.” “What are you talking about?” Ms Walsh asked. “Well, you can hear – I’ve lost my voice. But maybe I can act my part with a microphone.” “The drama group always works without microphones – and if you have one, everyone will need one. I’m afraid we can’t do it.” Moira looked at Ms Walsh coldly. “Then we’ll have to postpone the play.” “Postpone the play?” Ms Walsh was shocked. “We can’t!”

  Great success for the first Green Week at Camden School for Girls

  pupils made their green pledges for a better

  environment. Each day had a different motto. On Monday, for example, we all watched the excellent film “The Age of Stupid” to see what our planet will look like in 40 years. On Wednesday we

  The magic of the Mill 

  It is just one hour and a half on the motorway, but for many pupils it is like a fascinating trip into another world. Last week our Year 8 pupils spent a week at our field studies centre, the Mill, in Forest Green again. “First I thought, ‘Oh no, boring walks and lots of biology and geography exercises.’ But it turned out to be lots of fun,” Jeremy Fowler said when he came back. Mr Scott, one of the teachers who organized 

  the stay at the Mill, agreed: “It’s the combination of fieldwork and sport and adventures that makes it a fantastic trip.” The Mill is a great place for pupils to study birds and learn more about wildlife and plants. During the week, the pupils made posters about the birds which you can find at the Mill. With football and other games, there was a lot of exciting entertainment – even if some boys were not happy that there were no supermarkets or shops nearby. But this is what makes the Mill so special. “I haven’t really thought much about birds and other wild animals – we don’t see them much in Camden. But it’s almost magic to be away from the traffic and the noise of London for a few days,” Manish Malik said about his experience.

  In two weeks Year 8 will be off to the Mill. I’m sure they’ll have a great week. 

  Please make sure that your child brings camping things (a sleeping bag, a small rucksack, a plastic cup and plate, a knife, fork and spoon), enough clothes for a week, toothbrush/soap, a hat and an exercise book or diary. There are some games at the Mill, but pupils may also bring their own cards, games or books. 

  The children do not need to bring any extra food. There will be three meals a day. Pupils who are not able to eat certain foods or pupils who take medicine must bring a note with them and talk to Mr Glover before the trip. 

  The pupils are not allowed to bring radios, MP3 players, alcohol, computer games, mobile phones or pocket knives with them. If your child breaks the rules, we will ask you to come to the Mill and pick up your child immediately. 

  The pupils can walk to Forest Green, a small village near the Mill. There are no shops in Forest Green. As you know, teachers have already collected pocket money (£ 20/child), so pupils shouldn’t bring any extra money. They will be able to buy food, drinks, pens, pencils, etc. at a small shop at the Mill. 

  Many thanks for your help. Yours sincerely,

Only Jason, who slept next to George and Rajiv, was alone in his tent. Rajiv and George didn’t know Jason very well because he was very quiet. 

  Rajiv and George were asleep in their tent. Suddenly, they woke up. “Get off, get off!!” somebody screamed. It was Jason. Rajiv and George got up and looked out of their tent. Then they laughed. “Hey Jason, it’s only the tent! It’s fallen down.” The boys started to put it up

  At the Mill

  Rajiv and George got up later. They didn’t have time to take a shower and got dressed quickly.

  “Why don’t we help you go home?” Michael said with a strange laugh. Jason looked

  “Hurry up,” Rajiv said to George. They saw Jason a few metres away. “Come on, Jason. We’ll be late for breakfast,” George said. “Hey, where are your shoes?”

  “Oh, Jason. Here, you can wear my brown shoes,” Rajiv said. 

  At breakfast, Mr Glover stood up. “This morning I found these shoes by the river,” he said and held up a wet pair of shoes. “You all know you’re not allowed to go down there without a teacher. The owner should come and see me after breakfast.” Everyone knew whose shoes they were and Jason felt terrible again. Rajiv and George felt sorry for him, but they saw a few boys laugh. 

  And the day only got worse for Jason. When the boys did a quiz, Jason lost. And he was late for lunch. Finally, he 

  couldn’t find his exercise book for his geography project. When one of the pupils found it and gave it to Mr Glover, it looked terrible. It was very dirty and Mr Glover said, “This looks like it has come straight from the bin.” Jason went red in the face when all the other boys laughed. 

  Later, Jason sat near the tents. George saw him and said, “Hi Jason, I guess you’ve had quite a bad day.” “Yeah,“ said Jason. “Mr Glover is really angry with me. But you know what? I didn’t really …” 

  Just then two other boys walked up to them. It was Michael and Matt. They were the class clowns. They often played tricks on other boys and were always in trouble. Matt had something small and red in his hands. “Hey, Jason, are you having a bad day?” he said. “You should go home to your mum!”

  Glover weren’t at dinner. At about 7 o’clock Mr Glover came into the games room. He was upset. “Now, you may have noticed that Jason isn’t here,” he said to the boys. “When we checked the tents, we found this red pocket knife under Jason’s sleeping bag. We told you that you mustn’t bring knives to the Mill. So we are going to send Jason home.” 

  George looked at the red knife, then he looked at Matt and Michael. They were smiling. Suddenly George knew where he had seen the knife before – in Matt’s hand that afternoon! George knew it wasn’t Jason’s knife and now he knew why Jason was so frightened and unhappy. “Matt and Michael are bullying him!” he thought. But George didn’t know what to do. Should he tell Rajiv? Should he tell Mr Glover? But Jason’s parents were on the way already. Should he talk to Matt and Michael? What was the right thing to do?

The shoes I found at the river were yours … And the geography project you gave me was a mess – but you had done some work, so I thought I would give you another chance.

  The pupils spent a day at London Zoo. They took part in a “Green Team Challenge” about the problems of gorillas today. They watched the gorillas, found out about the danger to them in Africa and learned what we can do to save them. 

  “I usually just look at the animals for fun, but I never thought about their situation in Africa,” said Danny Mumbanga. “Now I know more about what we can do to help.” His teacher, Mr Scott, agreed. “It isn’t the same if we talk about animals in class and how you can save them. With London Zoo’s programme, pupils understand better how much danger the gorillas are in.” 

  Mr Scott and his class are now planning to collect 2 money to help London Zoo’s programme to save gorillas in Africa. The gorillas’ real kingdom in the African rainforest should survive 3 !

  your nose. It was your own fault, wasn’t it? George: What??? The fact is that Oliver was pushing me! And while he was chasing the ball he hit me on the nose with his elbow. And it sure wasn’t an accident!

  Lewis: You are only saying that because your 

  team lost the match. George: Well, Oliver fell down while he was running. I didn’t push him, did I?

  Battling to break the records 

  Last week Camden School for Girl’s Sports Day took place at Finsbury Park. As always years 7-9 battled it out for the house cups. 

  The day started with the long jump. Meredith Lambert (Year 9) jumped the furthest. She broke the school record and put Red House in the lead. However,

  Rachel Cullen (Year 8) and Alex Eastman 25 place. But it was clear that the winning

  10

  (Year 9) of Yellow House did fantastically well in the high jump. So the Yellows took the lead. In the afternoon there were some really

  house was going to be Red or Yellow. 

  The atmosphere in the stadium was tense. Finally, it was the Year 9 relay that decided everything. The Yellows came in

  exciting races. Ronke Yussuf (Year 8) won 30 first, and they won the House Cup!

  15

  the 100m and 200m sprints. Great running, Ronke! Alex Eastman was the fastest in Year 9. Both girls scored points for Yellow House.

  The audience cheered for ages. 

  In the afternoon everyone enjoyed the fun and games. As

  In the relays it was neck and neck 35 usual the fun relay

  against the teachers was a highlight. The teachers won narrowly. Well done to all!

  Caroline and I were really excited about Sports Day. The weeks before the big day we trained for at least half an hour after school every day. I took the race more seriously now. Thanks to Caroline I was running much more confidently and was getting so much better. Caroline wanted to come first in one of her races so she trained very hard and she ran faster from week to week.

  Nothing can stop the Reds! Nothing can stop the Reds! We’ll never give up! We’ll never give in! We’ll fight to the end, we’ve come here to win!

There was still time to send a message over the microphone. I ran to Mrs Shimmin, who was doing the “shout-outs” and wrote mine down quickly. Then I went back to my seat to watch the race. I crossed my fingers for luck. I knew how much Caroline wanted to win.

  Sports in London 

  In 2012, billions of people from all over the world watched their athletes when they competed for 1 medals at the 30th Summer Olympic Games. The sports events took place in many new sports facilities 2 , the Olympic Stadium for example. Now Londoners can use the facilities and have moved into 3 the Olympic Village.

  This does not mean, however, that there is no more world-class sport, because London is the home of many top sports events: In late March or early April, there is the famous University Boat Race on the River Thames. Students from the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford have competed against each other in rowing boats every spring for more than 150 years. In April, thousands of runners come to London for the London Marathon, one of the biggest marathons in the world. On the first weekend in July, the best tennis players in the world fight for glory 4 in the Wimbledon finals. In the summer months, cricket is one of the most popular sports because you need good weather and a lot of sunshine as matches can last a few days. All year round, you can go and see football and rugby matches. There are a number of Premier League football teams in London – Arsenal and Chelsea are just two of them. Many matches of England’s national team are played at Wembley Stadium as well as the English cup final. Twickenham Stadium is sometimes called the home of English rugby. In spring, it is here that matches of the Six Nations rugby tournament 5 take place – a competition between the six best European rugby teams.

  The Boy in the Dress 

  O1 a) Look at these clothes. Are there any that are for boys only or for girls only? 

  shoes · trousers · tie · skirt · socks · suit · dress · shirt · T-shirt · gloves · boots · jacket · coat · football boots · scarf · hat · shorts

  O2 Reading, p. 125 Read the first part of the story and say why the boys wear dresses. 

  Dennis lives with his dad and brother. His mother left the family some time ago and Dennis misses her very much. He misses her clothes, too, and he becomes interested in fashion. His father is not very happy about this, but Dennis shares his love of beautiful dresses with his new friend, Lisa. One day Lisa persuades him to wear a dress to school. The headmaster, Mr Hawtrey, expels him. Dennis is the best football player in the school and that means that the school team are much weaker without him. When they play against Maudlin Street School in the cup final, they are losing 6-0 at half time, but still the headmaster refuses to let Dennis play.

  The second half was about to begin, and Maudlin Street were all waiting on the pitch 1 , eager to 2 finish off their demolition job 3 . The school’s team was nowhere to be seen. Had they

  “OI!” WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?” Dad. Dennis couldn’t believe it. Dad had never come to 20 see him play for the school before, and now here Dennis was, lying on the ground with tears in his eyes wearing a dress. He was going to be in so much trouble … But Dad looked at Dennis and

  “I called him at half-time,” said Darvesh. “After what you said about your Dad never seeing you play a match, I thought he wouldn’t want to miss this.” “Thanks, mate” said Dennis. Whenever he thought Darvesh couldn’t surprise him any more, couldn’t be a better friend, he went ahead
